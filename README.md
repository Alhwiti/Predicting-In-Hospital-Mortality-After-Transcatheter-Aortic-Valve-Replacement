# Predicting-In-Hospital-Mortality-After-Transcatheter-Aortic-Valve-Replacement

This repository contains our code and results for the paper titled: "Predicting In-Hospital Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using Preoperative Administrative Data and Statistical/Machine Learning", which was submitted to [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/). Our reporsitory contains the following:   

  - [Notebook code for predict in-hopsital survival post TAVR - Research question 1](https://github.com/Alhwiti/Predicting-In-Hospital-Mortality-After-Transcatheter-Aortic-Valve-Replacement/blob/main/Predict%20in-hopsital%20survival%20post%20TAVR%20-%20Research%20question%201.ipynb), which contains our code and results for research question 1 (i.e., whether the use of only pre-operative variables extracted from the NIS adminstrative database can be used to accurateyly predict in-hopsital survival/deaths post TAVR);  
  -[Notebook code for predict in-hopsital survival post TAVR - Research question 2](https://github.com/Alhwiti/Predicting-In-Hospital-Mortality-After-Transcatheter-Aortic-Valve-Replacement/blob/main/Predict%20in-hopsital%20survival%20post%20TAVR%20-%20Research%20question%202.ipynb), which contains our code and results for research question 2 (where time-based sampling is used to assess whether the statistical/machine learning models developed for research question 1 can be deployed without frequent retraining;  
  - []() which contains the results that we analyzed using Minitab;  and
  - []() which contains our Minitab file used for statistical analysis
 
 Furthermore, we provide the code used to develop our web app at [fmegahed/tavr_paper](https://github.com/fmegahed/tavr_paper], and the web app is hosted at <https://huggingface.co/spaces/fmegahed/tavr_project>
